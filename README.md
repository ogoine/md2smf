# md2smf
Tool for converting a markdown manuscript into an RTF file in Standard Manuscript Format

Under construction: I will add more documentation later.
In the meantime, here is what Standard Manuscript Format is: https://www.shunn.net/format/story.html

## Usage
Reads from stdin and prints to stdout.
Example: `python md2smf.py <manuscript.md >manuscript.rtf`
For more info: `python md2smf.py --help`
